 **Project Overview**

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the creditcard.csv file, which contains historical credit card transaction data. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions based on various features such as transaction amount, time, location, and cardholder information.

**Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

1. **Importing the necessary libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd
```

This line imports the pandas library and assigns it the alias 'pd'. Pandas is a powerful library for data analysis and manipulation in Python.

2. **Loading the credit card transaction data**

```python
fd=pd.read_csv('/Users/saksham/CREDITCARDFARUDPROJECT/creditcard.csv')
```

This line uses the pandas read_csv() function to load the creditcard.csv file into a pandas DataFrame named 'fd'. The DataFrame is a tabular data structure that allows for easy manipulation and analysis of data.

3. **Exploring the data**

Before building the fraud detection model, it is important to explore the data to understand its characteristics and identify any patterns or anomalies. This can be done using various pandas methods such as head(), info(), and describe().

```python
fd.head()
fd.info()
fd.describe()
```

4. **Data Preprocessing**

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in machine learning to ensure the data is in a suitable format for modeling. This may involve handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and transforming the data to improve its quality.

```python
# Handle missing values
fd.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Deal with outliers
fd = fd[(fd['Amount'] < 250000) & (fd['Time'] < 1000000)]

# Transform the data
fd['Time'] = fd['Time'].astype('float')
fd['Amount'] = fd['Amount'].astype('float')
```

5. **Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing ones to improve the model's performance. This can be done based on domain knowledge or exploratory data analysis.

```python
# Create a new feature 'Transaction_Day'
fd['Transaction_Day'] = fd['Time'].dt.day

# Create a new feature 'Transaction_Hour'
fd
